      <h2>My BJJ Life</h2>
      <p>I've been training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) for about two years and currently hold a grey belt. As a 14-year-old freshman at high school, I train at <a href="https://btthappyvalley.com/" target="_blank">Brazilian Top Team (BTT) Happy Valley</a> under the guidance of head coach Gustavo Bessa.</p>
      <h3>About Brazilian Top Team Happy Valley</h3>
      <p>Established in 2009, BTT Happy Valley has been a leader in Oregon's martial arts community. In 2017, under the leadership of head coach Gustavo Bessa—a BJJ black belt and professional MMA fighter—the academy formalized its affiliation with the Brazilian Top Team organization. The academy offers a family-friendly atmosphere alongside professional competition training, helping students of all ages grow and excel.</p>
      <h3>About Coach Gustavo Bessa</h3>
      <p>Coach Bessa brings decades of experience as a professional MMA fighter and child development expert. He has assembled an expert team of coaches who focus on real-world self-defense, competition training, and promoting active, healthy lifestyles. No matter your age, skill, or fitness level, they are here to help you reach your goals.</p>
      <h3>My Training Experience</h3>
      <p>Training under Coach Bessa at BTT Happy Valley has been transformative. The emphasis on proper technique, discipline, and continuous improvement has not only enhanced my skills on the mat but also positively impacted other areas of my life. Balancing my high school studies with BJJ training has taught me time management and perseverance. The supportive community and expert instruction make it an ideal environment for anyone looking to pursue Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.</p>
