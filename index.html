      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hey, I'm Christian High, a dedicated software developer with over 4 years of experience in coding. My technical skills span across JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and C#. I have a strong interest in privacy, security, and the darknet, where I develop tools and applications that prioritize user anonymity and safety.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond coding, I’m passionate about martial arts, particularly Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, which has taught me discipline, focus, and resilience. I believe that the principles I learn on the mat translate directly into my work as a developer—problem-solving, persistence, and continuous learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m always looking for new challenges and opportunities to collaborate on innovative projects that make a difference.

      <h2>My BJJ Life</h2>
      <p>
        I've been training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) for about two years and currently hold a grey belt. As a 14-year-old freshman in high school, I train at 
        <a href="https://btthappyvalley.com/" target="_blank">Brazilian Top Team (BTT) Happy Valley</a>
        under the guidance of head coach Gustavo Bessa.
      </p>
      <h3>About BTT Happy Valley</h3>
      <p>
        Established in 2009, BTT Happy Valley is a leader in Oregon's martial arts community. In 2017, under head coach Gustavo Bessa—a BJJ black belt and professional MMA fighter—the academy formalized its affiliation with the Brazilian Top Team organization.
      </p>
      <h3>About Coach Gustavo Bessa</h3>
      <p>
        Coach Bessa brings decades of experience as a professional MMA fighter and child development expert. He leads a team of coaches focused on self-defense, competition training, and healthy lifestyles.
      </p>
      <h3>My Training Experience</h3>
      <p>
        Training under Coach Bessa has been transformative. Balancing high school with BJJ has taught me time management, perseverance, and the importance of continuous improvement.
